# XO4

XO-4 is a game originated from Tic Tac Toe (XO) game, but much more exciting and tricky. There exists 4 simple XO sheets (this is where '4' stands for) with rotation capaility. Besides, the winner has to align 5 pieced in row instead of 3. More diagonal alignment possibility will make it more really intellectual game. On the other hand, users will not have infinite time to move. The game has time limitation like chess which defines different time strategies like Blitz, Bullet, etc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8.

## Technology

The application has two parts, front-end and backend. The front-end has been developed based on Angular framework. The backend is suppsed to be developed on the Ethereum blockchain. But why blockchain? Blockchain is the promising future of the web applications. It prevents cheats and hacking issues, removes the need of trusting to 3rd-party, dApps will not be filterable by governments, provides definite privacy, the connections are peer-2-peer which leads to faster, more secure and more fair interactions. From Ride sharing to Marketplace, Music, chat apps and even Games all are going to be reimplemented on the blockchain. However still there exists some major issues, mainly the consensus latency, scalability, high-cost memory and computations, etc. Fortunately, the technology is going forward to fill these important gaps.

Ethereum blockchain would be a proper choice which provides some important facilities especially Dark Messaging, ie Whisper. Players' joining and movements would be transacted through Whisper and the checking and recording of the final result will be done on the blockchain via a smart contract.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
